Hi, I'm solo!\
I do programming, and mainly spend time contributing to open source projects.

Welcome to my personal blog! I mainly write posts about any tech related stuff that interests me.
This is mainly used as a collection of information that I wish to share with other people.

Check out my [Github] or my [Website].
