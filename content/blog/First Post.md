{{<katex>}}

Welcome to my blog!

I have a passion for technology and have always been interested in programming, Minecraft modding, and Linux. I plan to periodically use
this blog to discuss tech problems I had to solve or anything else I feel like.

So basically, Certified Nerd Shitâ„¢

Here are the main topics I'll be covering on this blog:

## Minecraft Modding

As someone who's been modding Minecraft for several years, I have quite a bit of experience with modding it. I primarily use the [Fabric]
and [Quilt] mod loaders, so will mainly be discussing them. However, I may also discuss [Mixins], a very powerful runtime bytecode
manipulator.

## JVM Languages

As I mainly focus on backend server-side development for the JVM, I'll be mainly be discussing the following JVM-based programming
languages:

- Java: A popular and widely-used programming language.
- [Kotlin]: A modern programming language that's designed to be concise, expressive, and easy to use.
- [Gradle]: A build automation system for Java and other JVM-based programming languages.

## \\(\LaTeX\\)

LaTeX is a typesetting system that's widely used in the scientific and academic communities.
I'll be talking about my continuous battle against LaTeX to try and get it to do what I want without some arcane bullshit.

I'll also probably post about some packages I created for LaTeX.

## Linux

I daily-drive Arch Linux as my primary operating system on both my desktop and my laptop, as well as host several Linux servers.
I'll talk about some of the following things:

- Problems I've experienced while using it on either my laptop or desktop
- Any interesting or not-well documented config shit
